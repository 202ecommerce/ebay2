Auto Index
=========

Automatically add an "index.php" in all your directories or your zip file recursively

## Getting Started

### Installation via composer

This projet is downloadable via Composer, the PHP Package Manager. We recommend having it in the `require-dev` section of your dependancies as it is not needed on production environments.

```
composer require --dev prestashop/autoindex
```

### Installation via git clone

To use this script, choose one of the following options to get started:
* Download the latest release on Auto Index
* Fork this repository on GitHub

## Usage

- php-cli: `php bin/autoindex prestashop:add:index (/your/module/path)`

If you want to customize the "index.php" file, edit it in "[sources](https://github.com/PrestaShopCorp/autoindex/assets/)" directory
