## Installation

```
composer require --dev prestashop/php-dev-tools
```

When this project is successfully added to your dependencies, you can enable each review tool on your projet.

### PHP Cs fixer

```bash 
$ php vendor/bin/prestashop-coding-standards cs-fixer:init [--dest /path/to/my/project]
```

It'll create a configuration file `.php_cs.dist` in the root of your project.

### Phpstan

```bash
$ php vendor/bin/prestashop-coding-standards phpstan:init [--dest /path/to/my/project]
```

It'll create a default file `phpstan.neon` in `tests/phpstan`, that are required to run phpstan.
The default phpstan level is the lowest available, but we recommend you to update this value to get more recommandations.

PHPStan is not provided by our dependencies, because of the PHP compatibility from projects using this repository. We recommend you to install it globally on your environment:

```
composer global require phpstan/phpstan:^0.12
```

## Usage

The configuration files added in your project can be freely modified in order to match your needs.

Running the tools can be done by calling its binary:

### PHP CS Fixer

```php
php vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix
```

### PHPStan

If you have installed PHPStan globally and made the folder available in your PATH:

```php
$ _PS_ROOT_DIR_=<Path_to_PrestaShop> phpstan --configuration=tests/phpstan/phpstan.neon analyse <path1 [path2 [...]]>
```

Otherwise, you can specify the path to the PHPStan binary. For instance:

```php
$ _PS_ROOT_DIR_=<Path_to_PrestaShop> php ~/.composer/vendor/bin/phpstan.phar --configuration=tests/phpstan/phpstan.neon analyse <path1 [path2 [...]]>
```

### Autoindex

Applying an index.php file to all your project subfolders will be useful to avoid directories to be listed by the webserver.

```php
$ vendor/bin/autoindex
```

### Header Stamp

Your license headers can be updated by applying the header stamp.

Here is an example of call, applying the default license on a PrestaShop module:

```php
$ vendor/bin/header-stamp --license=assets/afl.txt --exclude=vendor,node_modules
```

Available options are provided with `--help`.
